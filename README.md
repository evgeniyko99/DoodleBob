# DoodleBob

Extra Credit Project for PLC 

Between a group of 6 students, we have to create our own programming language from SCRATCH. 
The language should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations (addituion, subtraction, division, and multiplicaton.

We will be writing everything in Python, given that we only need to perform basic operations, writing in a high-level interpreted language 
 wont affect efficieny. 
 
 Dont be fooled, Just like in SpongeBob, DoodleBob is the opposite of him. 
 
 HAVE FUN !!!
